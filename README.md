# CoasterTrack

## Overview

This app was created as my capstone project for Awesome Inc's developer bootcamp.  It is a social media app for roller coaster enthusiasts that allows them to track the coasters they have ridden.  It uses data pulled from the [RCDB API](https://github.com/fabianrguez/rcdb-api)
